<h3> Summer Work</h3>
    <p> Over the summer, I worked with 6-8 amazing kids. I watched them daily and we did so many different activities. The ages were from 2 to 9. We got to go several different places to wear them out! The car was packed with at least 6 carseats everyday and usually took about 20 minutes to get them buckled and ready. It was a busy, fun, learning experience. </p>
    
<h3> Pictures From My Summer Work</h3>
    <p> Here are some pictures that I took with some of the kids I had over the summer. We made our own tye-die shirts and then took pictures for the parents. </p>
